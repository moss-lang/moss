All commands in this file are assumed to be run within the Nix dev shell from the root of a clone of this repository.

The dev shell puts a script named `dev` on the `PATH`, which provides subcommands for various development tasks. For instance, to run the tests, use the `test` subcommand:

```sh
dev test
```
