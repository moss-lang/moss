# [VS Code extension for Quench][marketplace]

This extension provides support for the [Quench][] language via a [language
server][lsp], which it automatically downloads if you don't already have it
installed. To use, simply install this extension, open any file whose name ends
with `.qn`, and click the "Download" button if prompted.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node][]
- [VS Code][]

### Basics

The below instructions assume that your VS Code workspace is (the root of) the
Quench repo but your shell cwd is this directory (`editors/code` in the repo).

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then compile:

```sh
npm run compile
```

Next, from VS Code, press F5 to open a new window with this extension loaded.
Then open a Quench source file (such as `examples/hello.qn` from this
repository) to activate it as normal.
