quench 0.2.3

Here is an example Quench program:

    #!/usr/bin/env quench
    print("Hello, world!");

Save the above contents as hello.qn and run these commands:

    chmod +x hello.qn
    ./hello.qn

You should see this output:

    AST:

        (source_file (comment) (call function: (identifier) arguments: (arguments (string))))

    No diagnostics.

As you can see, Quench can parse your program, but can't run it yet. Stay tuned!
