quench 0.3.0

Here is an example Quench program:

    #!/usr/bin/env quench
    print("Hello, world!");

Save the above contents as hello.qn and run this command:

    quench run hello.qn

Or on a Unix-like system, you could instead run these two commands:

    chmod +x hello.qn
    ./hello.qn

Either way, you should see this output:

    console.log("Hello, world!");

As you can see, Quench compiled your program into JavaScript.
