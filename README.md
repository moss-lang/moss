# Quench [![CI][]][ci link] [![crates.io][]][crates.io link] [![docs.rs][]][docs.rs link] [![rustc version][]][rust release]

A programming language.

## Installation

### Linux

```sh
curl -o quench -L https://github.com/quench-lang/quench/releases/latest/download/quench-linux
chmod +x quench
sudo mv quench /usr/local/bin
```

### macOS 10

```sh
curl -o quench -L https://github.com/quench-lang/quench/releases/latest/download/quench-macos
chmod +x quench
sudo mv quench /usr/local/bin
```

### Windows

Save [quench-windows.exe][] as `quench.exe` somewhere on your PATH.

## Usage

Pass `--help` to the binary you just installed:

```sh
quench --help
```

You will see an example Quench program and instructions on how to run it.

## Editors

Support (and instructions) for specific text editors can be found in the
[editors][] folder.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust][]

### Basics

Clone this repo, `cd` into it, and run an example using `cargo run`:

```sh
cargo run -- run examples/hello.qn
```

Or if you want to use the `#!/usr/bin/env quench` shebang, first install:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path .
```

Then run the example directly:

```sh
examples/hello.qn
```

Currently, running a valid Quench program produces an equivalent JavaScript
program on stdout. If you happen to have [Node][] or [Deno][] installed, you can
pipe a Quench program to either one to actually evaluate it.

### Other

If you want to modify the grammar, be sure to follow the instructions in the
[tree-sitter-quench][] folder.
